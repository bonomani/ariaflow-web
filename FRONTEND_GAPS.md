# ariaflow-dashboard Frontend Gaps

## Open (2)

### FE-18: No schema/test oracle for `/api/events` (deferred)

SSE stream at `/api/events` is outside the contract layer. Add an
event-stream test strategy only if SSE payload drift causes a regression.

### FE-22: Fallback to `/api/peers` when local mDNS unavailable

When the dashboard runs in environments without mDNS (WSL NAT, containers,
VMs), `discoverBackends()` gets no results from local browse. The backend's
`/api/peers` endpoint can provide peer info as a fallback.

Blocked by: BG-15 (backend discovery uses stale service type, so
`/api/peers` returns nothing).

Once BG-15 is fixed, the frontend should:
1. Try local mDNS browse first (current behavior).
2. If local browse returns nothing, fall back to `GET /api/peers` on the
   current backend and merge results into `mergeDiscoveredBackends()`.
